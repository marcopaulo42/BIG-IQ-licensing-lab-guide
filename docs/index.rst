Getting Started
===============

The aim of this lab is to familiarise you regarding the FCP licensing with BIG-IQ Centralized Manager (BIG-IQ CM) and BIG-IP VEs.

This lab environment contains newly deployed BIG-IQ CM and two BIG-IP virtual appliances. (The Linux Jumphost is used to host this document)

Continue to :ref:`Module 1 <1-licensing>` to license and setup the BIG-IQ CM.
